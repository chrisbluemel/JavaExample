This is an expansion of the plenary protocol parser and mongoDB Interface by adding NLP Analyzer. I developed both of these during a previous iteration of the exercise. This code is not functional without access to a cluster setup with an NLP Analyzer or a MongoDB database to store the data in. I suggest only using this as an example on how to interface publically available XML data with an individual database.
